## Overview of the analysis: 
The purpose of the surfs_up Statical Analysis is retrieve the temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the "surf and ice cream shop" business is sustainable year-round.For this,I will filter the date column of the Measurements table in the hawaii.sqlite database to retrieve all the temperatures for the month of June, then convert those temperatures to a list and create a DataFrame from the list, and generate the summary statistics.I will do same thing to retrieve all the temperatures for the month of December also, then convert those temperatures to a list and create a DataFrame from the list, and generate the summary statistics.After getting summary statics for both months I can analize easily to determine if the "surf and ice cream shop" business is sustainable year-round or not.
